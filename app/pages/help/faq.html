        <p>
            No. Unfortunately, not every traffic ticket that gets contested is dismissed or reduced. Here is what we do promise:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>We will treat your ticket as if it were our own and do our best to maximize your chances of success.</li>
            <li>You will not be worse off for having used our service. If your case is not successful (dismissed, amended or deferred), we’ll automatically refund your fee.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="faq8" class="faq-question">What are the possible outcomes when I fight my traffic ticket?</h3>

        <p>
        When you get a traffic ticket and you simply pay the fine, that ticket will stay on your driving record for the next few years. Your insurance premiums are very likely to increase, and you will be dealt with more harshly if you get future tickets. Here are the possible outcomes when you fight your traffic ticket:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Full Dismissal
                <p>If you have a spotless record, or if your ticket has errors or inconsistencies, there’s a good chance that your lawyer will be able to get the ticket completely dismissed. In other words, you won’t have to pay the fine, and it will never show up on your record. It will be as if it never happened.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Reduced to Non-Moving Violation
                <p>If your ticket does not have any errors, or if the judge and prosecutor have enough reason to believe that you committed the infraction, then your lawyer will negotiate with the judge and prosecutor to reduce the charge to a non-moving violation instead of a moving violation. When this happens, you usually still have to pay the fine, but the ticket will not show up on your driving record. Often, your lawyer will be able to argue for a lower fine, but the real savings is that your insurance premiums cannot increase because of this ticket, and future traffic tickets will not have a compound effect.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Point Reduction
                <p>In cases where the lawyer can't fully reduce the citation to a Non-Moving Violation then the next best outcome is to reduce the number of points a citation may carry.
                Reducing points will prevent possible license suspension and lower your impact to your insurance premium as some agencies base it on the number of points your driving record holds.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Deferral
                <p>If this is your first traffic ticket, your lawyer will ask you if you’re interested in deferring the ticket. Deferring a ticket means that the court is willing to turn a blind eye to the ticket if you don’t get another one for at least the next year. Deferred tickets do not appear on your driving record.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Committed (Case Lost)
                <p>Even though the vast majority of drivers who contest a traffic ticket get a dismissal or a reduction, sometimes nothing can be done to avoid the full penalty. Our lawyers will fight hard to avoid this scenario, but it is always a possibility. In this scenario, you’ll end up having to pay your original ticket fine. To alleviate some pain, when this happens, Off the Record will issue you a full refund of the service fee you paid to contest your ticket. Keep in mind that if you had hired a lawyer on your own, chances are you would not get a refund of the legal fees you paid. We feel that having to pay your ticket is vexing enough as it is. You will never be at a loss for having used our services.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="faq9" class="faq-question">Do you have a money back guarantee? </h3>
        <p>
            Yes we do. We want to encourage you to contest your traffic tickets without having more to lose. We know that traffic tickets are a financial burden. The last thing we want to do is add to that pain.
        </p>
        <p>
            If your case is not successful (i.e. If your ticket is not dismissed, amended or deferred) we will issue you a full refund. You don’t have to ask or email, we’ll just do it.
