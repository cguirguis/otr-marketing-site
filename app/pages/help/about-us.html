        <h3>Our mission</h3>
        <p>We're strong supporters of improving road safety through responsible driving. However, we also believe that everyone should have easy and affordable access to legal help when confronted with a traffic ticket. It's estimated that of the 41 million speeding tickets issued in the U.S. in 2014, over 25% were issued in error. Our mission is to help the country's 200 million drivers defend their driving records and protect their insurance premiums from unjust penalties. No one should ever lose their driving privileges - or face jail time - for a speeding ticket.</p>

        <blockquote>Depending on the violation, getting just a single ticket can boost an average policyholderâ€™s auto insurance premiums by as much as 22 percent.</blockquote>
