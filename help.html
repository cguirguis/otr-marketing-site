	<h3>What is Off the Record?</h3>
	<p>
		Off the Record is a innovative new service that makes it incredibly easy to fight your traffic tickets. You are legally entitled by law to contest any moving violation you are issued. However, cities and municipalities purposely make that process difficult to discourage you from doing so. We eliminate all of that hassle and confusion so that your ticket gets contested quickly and properly. 
	</p>

	<h3>How does it work?</h3>
	<p>
		If you've ever attempted to fight an unfair traffic ticket on your own, you know how difficulty and intimating the process can be. You have 15 days to respond to your ticket and can either pay, mitigate, or contest. Of course, the intelligent response is always to contest (see why <a href="whyfight.html">here</a>). After deciding you'd like to fight your ticket and mailing your ticket to the court, you'll need to wait several weeks for a court trial date, which is usually 1-2 months out. You'll need to take most of the day off of work to show up in court on that date, give your defense, and hope that the judge is sympathetic to your defense. In most cases, you would have wasted considerable time and effort for a small reduction to your fine, or no gain at all.

		Off the Record solves this dilemna. We've partned with some of the bets traffic lawyers in the area to ensure that when we take your case, it is assigned to the lawyer with the highest chance of getting your ticket dismissed. And our lawyers are experts on doing just that - with close to a 90% average dismissal rate. To use our service, you simply take a photo of your ticket, answer a few questions, and book your case to get the process started. You never need to mail your ticket in or step foot in court!  Your lawyer will send you updates through the app that will let you know what is going on with your case. In the event that your ticket doesn't get dismissed, we'll give you your money back, and you'll have the option of paying your original ticket at that time (with no additional or late fees).
